    <h6><strong id="1">What is Periodontology?</strong></h6>
      <li> Periodontology or Periodontics  is the specialty of dentistry that studies supporting structures of teeth, as well as diseases and conditions that affect them. </li>
      <li> The supporting tissues are known as the periodontium, which includes the gingiva (gums), alveolar bone, cementum, and the periodontal ligament. </li>

    <br/>
    <h6><strong id="2">Who is a Periodontist  or Periodontal Specialists?</strong></h6>
      <p>A periodontist is a dentist who specializes in the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of periodontal disease, and in the placement of dental implants.</p>
      <p>Periodontists receive extensive training in these areas, including three additional years of education to earn master of dental surgery in periodontics i.e.MDS after completing  BDS          i.e Bachelors of dental surgery. </p>
      <p>They are familiar with the latest techniques for diagnosing and treating periodontal disease, and are also trained in performing cosmetic periodontal procedures.</p>

    <br/>
    <h6><strong id="3">What is Periodontitis (Gum Disease)?</strong></h6>
      <p>
        Periodontitis, also generally called gum disease or periodontal disease, begins with bacterial growth in your mouth and may end -- if not properly treated -- with tooth loss due to destruction of the tissue that surrounds your teeth.
      </p>

    <br/>
    <h6><strong id="4">CAUSES OF GUM DISEASE</strong></h6>
      <p>Plaque is the primary cause of gum disease. However, other factors can contribute to periodontal disease. These include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li> Hormonal changes: pregnancy, puberty, menopause, and monthly menstruation, make gums more sensitive, which makes it easier for gingivitis/gum disease  to develop.</li>
        <li> Illnesses: diseases like cancer,HIV,diabetes etc  may interfere with the immune system  and affect the condition of your gums.</li> 
        <li> Medications:   Some drugs, such as the anticonvulsant medication Dilantin and the anti-anginadrug Procardia and Adalat, can cause abnormal growth of gum tissue.</li>
        <li> Bad habits:Smoking is a risk factor for gum disease. </li>
        <li> Poor oral hygiene habits:improper brushing/flossing and  inadequate oral hygiene practice, make it easier for gingivitis to develop.</li>
        <li> Family history of dental disease can be a contributing factor for the development of gingivitis.</li>
      </ul>

    <br/>
    <h6><strong id="5">SYMPTOMS OF GUM DISEASE</strong></h6>
      <ul>
        <li> Gums that bleed during and after tooth brushing</li>
        <li> Red, swollen, or tender gums</li>
        <li> Persistent bad breath or bad taste in the mouth</li>
        <li> Receding gums</li>
        <li> Formation of deep pockets between teeth and gums</li>
        <li> Loose or shifting teeth</li>
        <li> Changes in the way teeth fit together upon biting down, or in the fit of partial dentures.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Gum disease may progress painlessly, producing few obvious signs, even in the late stages of the disease.Even if you don't notice any symptoms, you may still have some degree of gum disease.  Only a dentist or a periodontist can recognize and determine the progression of gum disease.</p>

    <br/>
    <h6><strong id="6">DIAGNOSIS OF GUM DISEASE</strong></h6>
      <p>During a dental exam, your dentist typically checks for these things:<p>
      <ul>
        <li> Gum bleeding, swelling, firmness, and pocket depth (the space between the gum and tooth; the larger and deeper the pocket, the more severe the disease)</li>
        <li> Teeth movement and sensitivity and proper teeth alignment</li>
        <li> Your jawbone, to help detect the breakdown of bone surrounding your teeth</li>
      </ul>

    <br/>
    <h6><strong id="7">TREATMENT OF GUM DISEASE</strong></h6>
        <p>Treatment options depend on the stage of disease, how you may have responded to earlier treatments, and your overall health. Options range from nonsurgical therapies that control bacterial growth to surgery to restore supportive tissues.</p>
    <br/>
    <h6><strong id="8">GOALS OF GUM TREATMENT</strong></h6>
        <ul>
          <li> to promote reattachment of healthy gums to teeth</li>
          <li> to reduce swelling</li>
          <li> to reduce the depth of pockets, and the risk of infection</li>
          <li> to stop disease progression.</li>
        </ul>
    <br/>
    <h6><strong id="9">PREVENTION OF GUM DISEASE</strong></h6>
        <p>In most of the cases, gum disease can be reversed when proper plaque control is practiced. Proper plaque control consists of professional cleanings at least twice a year and daily brushing and flossing. According to the American Dental Association, antibacterial mouth rinses can reduce bacteria that cause plaque and gum disease.</p>

    <br/>
    <h6><strong id="10">RISK FACTORS</strong></h6>
      <p>Following factors can increase the severity, and speed of gum disease: </p>
      <ul>
        <li> SMOKING AND TOBACCO USE: Tobacco users and smokers are seven times more likely to get gum disease than nonsmokers. Also smoking can lower the chances of success of some treatments including dental implants.</li>
        <li> STRESS: Stress may make it difficult for your body's immune system to fight off infection.</li>
        <li> BALANCED DIET: Eating foods with antioxidant properties -for example,those containing vitamin E (vegetable oils, nuts, green leafy vegetables)and vitamin C (citrus fruits, broccoli, potatoes) -- can help your body repair damaged tissue. Proper nutrition helps your immune system fight infection.</li>
        <li> CLENCHING AND GRINDING TEETH: These actions may put excess force on the supporting tissues of the teeth and could increase the rate at which these tissues are destroyed.</li>
        <li> GENETIC SUSCEPTIBILITY: If anyone in your family has gum disease, it may mean that you are at greater risk as well. Genetically predisposed individuals may be up to six times more likely to develop some form of gum disease. </li>
      </ul>

    <br/>
    <h6><strong id="11">LINKING  GUM DISEASE TO OTHER HEALTH PROBLEMS</strong></h6>
      <p>Under certain circumstances,researchers have revealed potential links between gum disease and other serious health conditions such as Diabetes,heart disease,preterm low birth rates,respiratotory disease etc. </p>

    <br/>
    <h6><strong id="12">PERIODONTAL TREATMENTS AND PROCEDURES</strong>
      <ul>
        <li> Non-Surgical Periodontal Treatments</li>
        <li> Gum Graft Surgery</li>
        <li> Laser Treatment for Gum Disease</li>
        <li> Regenerative Procedures</li>
        <li> Dental Crown Lengthening Procedure</li>
        <li> Dental Implants</li>
        <li> Periodontal Pocket Reduction Procedures</li>
        <li> Periodontal Plastic Surgery Procedures</li>
      </ul>

    <br/>
    <h6><strong id="13">Dental Implants: Replacement Teeth That Look and Feel Like Your Own 
    Dental Implants </strong></h6>
      <p>A dental implant is an artificial tooth root that a periodontist places into your jaw to hold a replacement tooth or bridge.</p> 
      <p>Dental implants are an ideal option for people in good general oral and systemic  health who have lost a tooth or teeth due to periodontal disease, an injury, or some other reason.</p>
      <p>Under proper conditions,such as placement by a periodontist and diligent patient maintenance,implants can last a lifetime.</p>

    <br/>
    <h6><strong id="14">Advantages of Dental Implants over dentures or a bridge</strong></h6>
      <ul>
        <li> Esthetics: Dental implants look and feel like your own teeth</li>
        <li> Tooth saving: Structure of your neighboring teeth are not sacrificed to place or support your implants</li>
        <li> Confidence: Dental implants will allow you to once again to speak and eat with comfort and confidence</li>
        <li> Reliable:The success rate of dental implants is highly predictable</li>
      </ul>
